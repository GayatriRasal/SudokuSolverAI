# SudokuSolver by using AI backtracking algorithm(TY AI mini project).
This program solves a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using the Backtracking algorithm. It recursively fills empty cells by trying digits from 1 to 9, 
checking if the placement is valid according to Sudoku rules (no duplicate in row, column, or 3x3 grid).
If a conflict is found, it backtracks and tries the next possible number.
